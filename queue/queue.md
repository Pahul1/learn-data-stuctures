A Queue is an abstract data type (complex linear data structure) that has a processing order of First In, First Out. It is a structure in which elements are inserted at the <strong>Rear</strong> (or called tail) and deleted/removed from the <strong>FRONT</strong> (or the head)

A Queue has two main operations:
1. Enqueue: Insert an element at the tail of the queue
2. Dequeue: Remove the element at the front of the queue

There should also some functionality to get the first element's value (peek()).
