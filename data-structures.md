Anything that can store data can be called a data structure. For example integer, float, char, string, etc are also considered data structures, but they are known as <strong>Primitive Data Structures</strong>.

In more detail, a Primitive Data Structure is a struct that stores data of only one type. A primitive data structure must contain a value (cannot be null). For example, in javascript there are 7 primitive data types:
`string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null`

Another type of data structures are called complex data strtuctures. They are used to store large and connected data. Ex: Linked List, Array, Tree. These data structures allow us to perform different operations on the data, hence we select which data structure to use based on the operation required.

Complex data structures can have 6 characteristic:
1. Linear -> Data items are arranged in a linear sequence: Array
2. Non-Linear -> Data Structure does not have any sequence: Graph
3. Homogeneous -> All elements are of the same type
4. Non-Homogeneous -> Can be different types
5. Static -> data structures whose size and memory locations are fixed at compile time : Static Array
6. Dynamic -> size can shrink or expand based on needs of program. Memory locations changes: Linked list created by pointers
